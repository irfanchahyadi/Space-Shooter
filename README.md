My frist game, built using pygame.
I create this game to lean more about Object Oriented Programming in python while, of course, having fun.

Install required tools
```
pip3 install pygame
```
### How to play:
run `space shooter.py`.
You can shoot a missile with `space key` and navigate using `arrow key`. Destroy every obstacles and get the highest score, but don't let this obstacles hit your space ship. The red square thing will upgrade your weapon for maximum damage. Oh, also, don't forget to increase your volume, because it has a great sound effect!
